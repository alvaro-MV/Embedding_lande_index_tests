Reflecting the Full Diversity of Human Understanding
A multicultural and global perspective is a central organizing principle of Introduction to Philosophy. This text
explores Eastern, African, and Indigenous perspectives in concert with and, in some cases, in juxtaposition to
classical Western thinkers. Additionally, the authors have made a special effort to highlight the philosophical
work of women, who have made important contributions to the history of philosophy in numerous traditions.
This broader emphasis introduces students to approaches that open up traditional philosophical questions in
provocative ways, offering fresh possibilities for social and individual understanding. As just one example,
alongside discussion of the individualistic ways that Hume and Locke attempted to answer the question “what
is the self” appears discussion of the African concept of ubuntu, sometimes translated as “a person is a person
through other persons.” Discussions of the four noble truths of Buddhism as a path to achieve liberation from
suffering, the four interrelated concepts at the heart of Mohist ethical theory, and Carol Gilligan’s care ethics
are other examples of well-established answers to deep philosophical questions that provide fresh additions to
classical Western ways of thinking.
Providing Students with Transferable Skills
Introduction to Philosophy is intentionally organized to develop critical thinking, research, reading, and
writing skills. There is an entire chapter devoted to these transferrable skills associated with philosophy.
Another chapter addresses logic and reasoning. Additionally, interspersed throughout the text are features
providing guidance on how to read philosophy effectively, how to conduct research and evaluate sources, and
how to write philosophy papers. These features aim to be very explicit about the habits and practices that
enable one to be a good student of philosophy and, by extension, a good critical thinker.
Reminding Readers that Philosophy Is a Living Discipline
Calling attention to the fact that philosophy is not just a feature of our human past, Introduction to Philosophy
discusses the ways contemporary academic philosophers address some of our most pressing ethical and
moral issues. Examples include discussions of bioethics, emerging issues surrounding genetic engineering
and communication technologies, what brain science can and cannot tell us about human consciousness, and
morality pertaining to human treatment of the natural world. Through discussion of these topics and others,
readers will gain awareness of the range of answers that contemporary philosophers offer to current issues
and learn to appreciate the type of reasoning that philosophers use. Throughout the text, students are also
encouraged to critically reflect on philosophical points of view and develop their own philosophical positions.
Enriching and Engaging Features
“Doing” Philosophy
While there is certainly not one method of “doing” philosophy, there are practices and habits that make
someone a better reader, writer, researcher, and thinker in philosophy. A set of recurring features makes these
skills explicit and concrete, with guidance geared toward the introductory student.
•
Think Like a Philosopher. These features adopt one of two approaches. Some instances prompt students
to engage with concepts key to philosophical argument, and thus to critical thinking, either in the form of
interactive online exercises or as written guidance. Others guide students in formulating their own
approaches to philosophical questions.
•
Write Like a Philosopher. These features challenge the reader to articulate their own written responses to
philosophical prompts or to craft their own philosophical arguments. Clear guidance is given on both the
considerations that should appear in the response and the most effective structure for written
philosophical discourse.
•
Read Like a Philosopher. These features prompt students to engage with portions of key primary texts,
such as Plato’s Apology or the Daodejing. Clear structure is provided, guiding the reader on what elements
of the text to pay close attention to and what questions they should hold in their minds while reading.

“How It All Hangs Together”
Philosophy is an inherently interconnected undertaking that speaks to universal human concerns. The broad
questions philosophers ask (e.g., what makes a good life, how does one define morality, how should people
treat one another, what rights should be accorded individuals within society) touch many aspects of our social
and individual existences. A number of features address the interconnectedness of philosophical inquiry and
philosophical thought, as well as its relevance to all lives.
•
Connections features. Throughout the text, callouts direct students to additional coverage of both
important theories and key thinkers in other chapters.
•
Videos. Video features provide supplemental information from trusted contemporary sources, such as the
BBC Radio 4 series A History of Ideas and the e-series Wi-Phi Philosophy.
•
Podcasts. Podcast links are provided from engaging series, such as The History of Philosophy without Any
Gaps and Philosophy Bites.
Pedagogical Framework
An effective pedagogical framework helps students structure their learning and retain information.
•
Chapter Outlines. Each chapter opens with an outline and introduction, familiarizing students with the
material that will follow. Throughout the chapter, material is chunked into manageable sections of content
within each of the larger main heads.
•
Learning Objectives. Every main section begins with two to five clear, concise, and measurable learning
objectives, tagged to Bloom’s levels. These objectives are designed to help the instructor decide what
content to include or assign and to guide student expectations. After completing the textual sections and
end-of-chapter exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives.
•
Chapter Summaries. Organized by section heads, chapter summaries distill the information presented in
each chapter to key, concise points.
•
Key Terms. Key terms are bolded and followed by in-text definitions. A glossary of key terms also appears
at the end of each chapter.
•
Critical Thinking Questions. Each chapter ends with 10 to 20 critical thinking questions, also organized
by section head. Some of these questions assess recall of key concepts, while others ask students to think,
read, and write like a philosopher. These more complex questions might prompt students to formulate
thoughtful critiques of existing philosophical positions or to begin to articulate their own thoughts on
philosophical questions. Any of these components can be used by instructors to build assessments and
assignments for their courses.
•
Student and Instructor Resources
We’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including an instructor’s manual, test
bank, and lecture slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for
when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org. Take advantage of these resources to supplement

topics as a starting place for instructors to build their lectures. Authored by Gregory Browne, Eastern
Michigan University.
Academic Integrity
Academic integrity builds trust, understanding, equity, and genuine learning. While students may encounter
significant challenges in their courses and their lives, doing their own work and maintaining a high degree of
authenticity will result in meaningful outcomes that will extend far beyond their college career. Faculty,
administrators, resource providers, and students should work together to maintain a fair and positive
experience.
We realize that students benefit when academic integrity ground rules are established early in the course. To
that end, OpenStax has created an interactive to aid with academic integrity discussions in your course.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER OUTLINE
1.1 What Is Philosophy?
1.2 How Do Philosophers Arrive at Truth?
1.3 Socrates as a Paradigmatic Historical Philosopher
1.4 An Overview of Contemporary Philosophy
For most college students, an Introduction to Philosophy course is their first encounter with
the study of philosophy. Unlike most of your other courses, philosophy is not something usually covered in
high school. Yet you are probably familiar with the term philosophy and may have some preconceived notion
about what philosophy is and what philosophers do. Perhaps you have stayed up late at night talking with
friends or family about topics like free will or the existence of God. Maybe you have a friend who always talks
about big ideas or asks tough questions that sound like riddles. Perhaps you think of them as “philosophical”;
you might be right.
In this chapter, we will provide a brief introduction to the field of philosophy as a historical and academic
discipline. This first chapter should prepare you for your philosophy course and give you a better idea of what
it means to be a philosopher. As with all introductions, this one is just a start. Your job is to explore more, think
more, read more, and write more like a philosopher. Soon you may even find that you are doing philosophy.

Introduction to Philosophy

1.1 What Is Philosophy?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify sages (early philosophers) across historical traditions.
•
Explain the connection between ancient philosophy and the origin of the sciences.
•
Describe philosophy as a discipline that makes coherent sense of a whole.
•
Summarize the broad and diverse origins of philosophy.
It is difficult to define philosophy. In fact, to do so is itself a philosophical activity, since philosophers are
attempting to gain the broadest and most fundamental conception of the world as it exists. The world includes
nature, consciousness, morality, beauty, and social organizations. So the content available for philosophy is
both broad and deep. Because of its very nature, philosophy considers a range of subjects, and philosophers
cannot automatically rule anything out. Whereas other disciplines allow for basic assumptions, philosophers
cannot be bound by such assumptions. This open-endedness makes philosophy a somewhat awkward and
confusing subject for students. There are no easy answers to the questions of what philosophy studies or how
one does philosophy. Nevertheless, in this chapter, we can make some progress on these questions by (1)
looking at past examples of philosophers, (2) considering one compelling definition of philosophy, and (3)
looking at the way academic philosophers today actually practice philosophy.
Historical Origins of Philosophy
One way to begin to understand philosophy is to look at its history. The historical origins of philosophical
thinking and exploration vary around the globe. The word philosophy derives from ancient Greek, in which the
philosopher is a lover or pursuer (philia) of wisdom (sophia). But the earliest Greek philosophers were not
known as philosophers; they were simply known as sages. The sage tradition provides an early glimpse of
philosophical thought in action. Sages are sometimes associated with mathematical and scientific discoveries
and at other times with their political impact. What unites these figures is that they demonstrate a willingness
to be skeptical of traditions, a curiosity about the natural world and our place in it, and a commitment to
applying reason to understand nature, human nature, and society better. The overview of the sage tradition
that follows will give you a taste of philosophy’s broad ambitions as well as its focus on complex relations
between different areas of human knowledge. There are some examples of women who made contributions to
philosophy and the sage tradition in Greece, India, and China, but these were patriarchal societies that did not
provide many opportunities for women to participate in philosophical and political discussions.
The Sages of India, China, Africa, and Greece
In classical Indian philosophy and religion, sages play a central role in both religious mythology and in the
practice of passing down teaching and instruction through generations. The Seven Sages, or Saptarishi (seven
rishis in the Sanskrit language), play an important role in sanatana dharma, the eternal duties that have come
to be identified with Hinduism but that predate the establishment of the religion. The Seven Sages are partially
considered wise men and are said to be the authors of the ancient Indian texts known as the Vedas. But they
are partly mythic figures as well, who are said to have descended from the gods and whose reincarnation
marks the passing of each age of Manu (age of man or epoch of humanity). The rishis tended to live monastic
lives, and together they are thought of as the spiritual and practical forerunners of Indian gurus or teachers,
even up to today. They derive their wisdom, in part, from spiritual forces, but also from tapas, or the
meditative, ascetic, and spiritual practices they perform to gain control over their bodies and minds. The
stories of the rishis are part of the teachings that constitute spiritual and philosophical practice in
contemporary Hinduism.
Figure 1.2 depicts a scene from the Matsya Purana, where Manu, the first man whose succession marks the
prehistorical ages of Earth, sits with the Seven Sages in a boat to protect them from a mythic flood that is said
to have submerged the world. The king of serpents guides the boat, which is said to have also contained seeds,

plants, and animals saved by Manu from the flood.

Despite the fact that classical Indian culture is patriarchal, women figures play an important role in the earliest
writings of the Vedic tradition (the classical Indian religious and philosophical tradition). These women figures
are partly connected to the Indian conception of the fundamental forces of nature—energy, ability, strength,
effort, and power—as feminine. This aspect of God was thought to be present at the creation of the world. The
Rig Veda, the oldest Vedic writings, contains hymns that tell the story of Ghosha, a daughter of Rishi Kakshivan,
who had a debilitating skin condition (probably leprosy) but devoted herself to spiritual practices to learn how
to heal herself and eventually marry. Another woman, Maitreyi, is said to have married the Rishi Yajnavalkya
(himself a god who was cast into mortality by a rival) for the purpose of continuing her spiritual training. She
was a devoted ascetic and is said to have composed 10 of the hymns in the Rig Veda. Additionally, there is a
famous dialogue between Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya in the Upanishads (another early, foundational collection
of texts in the Vedic tradition) about attachment to material possessions, which cannot give a person
happiness, and the achievement of ultimate bliss through knowledge of the Absolute (God).
Another woman sage named Gargi also participates in a celebrated dialogue with Yajnavalkya on natural
philosophy and the fundamental elements and forces of the universe. Gargi is characterized as one of the most
knowledgeable sages on the topic, though she ultimately concedes that Yajnavalkya has greater knowledge. In
these brief episodes, these ancient Indian texts record instances of key women who attained a level of
enlightenment and learning similar to their male counterparts. Unfortunately, this early equality between the
sexes did not last. Over time Indian culture became more patriarchal, confining women to a dependent and
subservient role. Perhaps the most dramatic and cruel example of the effects of Indian patriarchy was the
ritual practice of sati, in which a widow would sometimes immolate herself, partly in recognition of the “fact”
that following the death of her husband, her current life on Earth served no further purpose (Rout 2016).
Neither a widow’s in-laws nor society recognized her value.

In similar fashion to the Indian tradition, the sage (sheng) tradition is important for Chinese philosophy.
Confucius, one of the greatest Chinese writers, often refers to ancient sages, emphasizing their importance for
their discovery of technical skills essential to human civilization, for their role as rulers and wise leaders, and
for their wisdom. This emphasis is in alignment with the Confucian appeal to a well-ordered state under the
guidance of a “philosopher-king.” This point of view can be seen in early sage figures identified by one of the
greatest classical authors in the Chinese tradition, as the “Nest Builder” and “Fire Maker” or, in another case,
the “Flood Controller.” These names identify wise individuals with early technological discoveries. The Book of
Changes, a classical Chinese text, identifies the Five (mythic) Emperors as sages, including Yao and Shun, who
are said to have built canoes and oars, attached carts to oxen, built double gates for defense, and fashioned
bows and arrows (Cheng 1983). Emperor Shun is also said to have ruled during the time of a great flood, when
all of China was submerged. Yü is credited with having saved civilization by building canals and dams.
FIGURE 1.3 The Chinese philosopher and historian Han Feizi identified sages with technological discoveries.

These figures are praised not only for their political wisdom and long rule, but also for their filial piety and
devotion to work. For instance, Mencius, a Confucian philosopher, relates a story of Shun’s care for his blind
father and wicked stepmother, while Yü is praised for his selfless devotion to work. In these ways, the Chinese
philosophical traditions, such as Confucianism and Mohism, associate key values of their philosophical
enterprises with the great sages of their history. Whether the sages were, in fact, actual people or, as many
scholars have concluded, mythical forebearers, they possessed the essential human virtue of listening and
responding to divine voices. This attribute can be inferred from the Chinese script for sheng, which bears the
symbol of an ear as a prominent feature. So the sage is one who listens to insight from the heavens and then is
capable of sharing that wisdom or acting upon it to the benefit of his society (Cheng 1983). This idea is similar
to one found in the Indian tradition, where the most important texts, the Vedas, are known as shruti, or works
that were heard through divine revelation and only later written down.
Although Confucianism is a venerable world philosophy, it is also highly patriarchal and resulted in the
widespread subordination of women. The position of women in China began to change only after the
Communist Revolution (1945–1952). While some accounts of Confucianism characterize men and women as
10

emblematic of two opposing forces in the natural world, the Yin and Yang, this view of the sexes developed over
time and was not consistently applied. Chinese women did see a measure of independence and freedom with
the influence of Buddhism and Daoism, each of which had a more liberal view of the role of women (Adler
2006).
A detailed and important study of the sage tradition in Africa is provided by Henry Odera Oruka (1990), who
makes the case that prominent folk sages in African tribal history developed complex philosophical ideas.
Oruka interviewed tribal Africans identified by their communities as sages, and he recorded their sayings and
ideas, confining himself to those sayings that demonstrated “a rational method of inquiry into the real nature
of things” (Oruka 1990, 150). He recognized a tension in what made these sages philosophically interesting:
they articulated the received wisdom of their tradition and culture while at the same time maintaining a
critical distance from that culture, seeking a rational justification for the beliefs held by the culture.
CONNECTIONS
The chapter on the early history of philosophy covers this topic in greater detail.
FIGURE 1.4 Engraving of Greek historian Diogenes Laërtius from a 1688 edition of his Lives and Opinions of
Eminent Philosophers. (credit: “Diogenes Laërtius, ancient Greek writer” by Unidentified engraver/Wikimedia
Commons, Public Domain)
Among the ancient Greeks, it is common to identify seven sages. The best-known account is provided by
Diogenes Laërtius, whose text Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers is a canonical resource on early
Greek philosophy. The first and most important sage is Thales of Miletus. Thales traveled to Egypt to study with
the Egyptian priests, where he became one of the first Greeks to learn astronomy. He is known for bringing
back to Greece knowledge of the calendar, dividing the year into 365 days, tracking the progress of the sun
from solstice to solstice, and—somewhat dramatically—predicting a solar eclipse in 585 BCE. The eclipse
occurred on the day of a battle between the Medes and Lydians. It is possible that Thales used knowledge of
Babylonian astronomical records to guess the year and location of the eclipse. This mathematical and
astronomical feat is one of Thales’s several claims to sagacity. In addition, he is said to have calculated the
1.1 • What Is Philosophy?
11

height of the pyramids using the basic geometry of similar triangles and measuring shadows at a certain time
of day. He is also reported to have predicted a particularly good year for olives: he bought up all the olive
presses and then made a fortune selling those presses to farmers wanting to turn their olives into oil. Together,
these scientific and technical achievements suggest that at least part of Thales’s wisdom can be attributed to a
very practical, scientific, and mathematical knowledge of the natural world. If that were all Thales was known
for, he might be called the first scientist or engineer. But he also made more basic claims about the nature and
composition of the universe; for instance, he claimed that all matter was fundamentally made of up water. He
also argued that everything that moved on its own possessed a soul and that the soul itself was immortal.
These claims demonstrate a concern about the fundamental nature of reality.

Another of the seven sages was Solon, a famed political leader. He introduced the “Law of Release” to Athens,
which cancelled all personal debts and freed indentured servants, or “debt-slaves” who had been consigned to
service based on a personal debt they were unable to repay. In addition, he established a constitutional
government in Athens with a representative body, a procedure for taxation, and a series of economic reforms.
He was widely admired as a political leader but voluntarily stepped down so that he would not become a tyrant.
He was finally forced to flee Athens when he was unable to persuade the members of the Assembly (the ruling
body) to resist the rising tyranny of one of his relatives, Pisistratus. When he arrived in exile, he was reportedly
asked whom he considered to be happy, to which he replied, “One ought to count no man happy until he is
dead.”
Aristotle interpreted this statement to mean that happiness was not a momentary experience, but a
quality reflective of someone’s entire life.
Beginnings of Natural Philosophy
The sage tradition is a largely prehistoric tradition that provides a narrative about how intellect, wisdom, piety,
and virtue led to the innovations central to flourishing of ancient civilizations. Particularly in Greece, the sage
tradition blends into a period of natural philosophy, where ancient scientists or philosophers try to explain
nature using rational methods. 
Several of the early Greek schools of philosophy were centered on their
respective views of nature. Followers of Thales, known as the Milesians, were particularly interested in the
underlying causes of natural change. Why does water turn to ice? What happens when winter passes into
spring? Why does it seem like the stars and planets orbit Earth in predictable patterns? From Aristotle we
know that Thales thought there was a difference between material elements that participate in change and
elements that contain their own source of motion. 
This early use of the term element did not have the same
meaning as the scientific meaning of the word today in a field like chemistry. But Thales thought material
elements bear some fundamental connection to water in that they have the capacity to move and alter their
state. By contrast, other elements had their own internal source of motion, of which he cites the magnet and
amber (which exhibits forces of static electricity when rubbed against other materials). He said that these
elements have “soul.” This notion of soul, as a principle of internal motion, was influential across ancient and
medieval natural philosophy. In fact, the English language words animal and animation are derived from the
Latin word for soul (anima).
Similarly, early thinkers like Xenophanes began to formulate explanations for natural phenomena. For
instance, he explained rainbows, the sun, the moon, and St. Elmo’s fire (luminous, electrical discharges) as
apparitions of the clouds. This form of explanation, describing some apparent phenomenon as the result of an
underlying mechanism, is paradigmatic of scientific explanation even today. Parmenides, the founder of the
Eleatic school of philosophy, used logic to conclude that whatever fundamentally exists must be unchanging
because if it ever did change, then at least some aspect of it would cease to exist. But that would imply that
what exists could not exist—which seems to defy logic. Parmenides is not saying that there is no change, but
that the changes we observe are a kind of illusion. Indeed, this point of view was highly influential, not only for
Plato and Aristotle, but also for the early atomists, like Democritus, who held that all perceived qualities are
merely human conventions. Underlying all these appearances, Democritus reasoned, are only atomic,
unchanging bits of matter flowing through a void. While this ancient Greek view of atoms is quite different
from the modern model of atoms, the very idea that every observable phenomenon has a basis in underlying
12

pieces of matter in various configurations clearly connects modern science to the earliest Greek philosophers.
Along these lines, the Pythagoreans provide a very interesting example of a community of philosophers
engaged in understanding the natural world and how best to live in it. You may be familiar with Pythagoras
from his Pythagorean theorem, a key principle in geometry establishing a relationship between the sides of a
right-angled triangle. Specifically, the square formed by the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is
equal to the sum of the two squares formed by the remaining two sides. In the figure below, the area of the
square formed by c is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares formed by a and b. The figure represents
how Pythagoras would have conceptualized the theorem.
FIGURE 1.5 The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle as
demonstrated by the ancient Greek philosopher, Pythagoras. (credit: modification of "Pythagorean right angle" by
Marianov/Wikimedia Commons, CC0)
The Pythagoreans were excellent mathematicians, but they were more interested in how mathematics
explained the natural world. In particular, Pythagoras recognized relationships between line segments and
shapes, such as the Pythagorean theorem describes, but also between numbers and sounds, by virtue of
harmonics and the intervals between notes. Similar regularities can be found in astronomy. As a result,
Pythagoras reasoned that all of nature is generated according to mathematical regularities. This view led the
Pythagoreans to believe that there was a unified, rational structure to the universe, that the planets and stars
exhibit harmonic properties and may even produce music, that musical tones and harmonies could have
healing powers, that the soul is immortal and continuously reincarnated, and that animals possess souls that
ought to be respected and valued. As a result, the Pythagorean community was defined by serious scholarship
as well as strict rules about diet, clothing, and behavior.
Additionally, in the early Pythagorean communities, it was possible for women to participate and contribute to
philosophical thought and discovery. Pythagoras himself was said to have been inspired to study philosophy by
the Delphic priestess Themistoclea. His wife Theano is credited with contributing to important discoveries in
the realms of numbers and optics. She is said to have written a treatise, On Piety, which further applies
Pythagorean philosophy to various aspects of practical life (Waithe 1987). Myia, the daughter of this illustrious
couple, was also an active and productive part of the community. At least one of her letters has survived in
which she discusses the application of Pythagorean philosophy to motherhood. The Pythagorean school is an
example of how early philosophical and scientific thinking combines with religious, cultural, and ethical
beliefs and practices to embrace many different aspects of life.
How It All Hangs Together
Closer to the present day, in 1962, Wilfrid Sellars, a highly influential 20th-century American philosopher,
wrote a chapter called “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man” in Frontiers of Science and Philosophy. He
opens the essay with a dramatic and concise description of philosophy: “The aim of philosophy, abstractly
formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
1.1 • What Is Philosophy?
13

broadest possible sense of the term.” If we spend some time trying to understand what Sellars means by this
definition, we will be in a better position to understand the academic discipline of philosophy. First, Sellars
emphasizes that philosophy’s goal is to understand a very wide range of topics—in fact, the widest possible
range. That is to say, philosophers are committed to understanding everything insofar as it can be understood.
This is important because it means that, on principle, philosophers cannot rule out any topic of study.
However, for a philosopher not every topic of study deserves equal attention. Some things, like conspiracy
theories or paranoid delusions, are not worth studying because they are not real. It may be worth
understanding why some people are prone to paranoid delusions or conspiratorial thinking, but the content of
these ideas is not worth investigating. Other things may be factually true, such as the daily change in number
of the grains of sand on a particular stretch of beach, but they are not worth studying because knowing that
information will not teach us about how things hang together. So a philosopher chooses to study things that are
informative and interesting—things that provide a better understanding of the world and our place in it.
To make judgments about which areas are interesting or worthy of study, philosophers need to cultivate a
special skill. Sellars describes this philosophical skill as a kind of know-how (a practical, engaged type of
knowledge, similar to riding a bike or learning to swim). Philosophical know-how, Sellars says, has to do with
knowing your way around the world of concepts and being able to understand and think about how concepts
connect, link up, support, and rely upon one another—in short, how things hang together. Knowing one’s way
around the world of concepts also involves knowing where to look to find interesting discoveries and which
places to avoid, much like a good fisherman knows where to cast his line. Sellars acknowledges that other
academics and scientists know their way around the concepts in their field of study much like philosophers do.
The difference is that these other inquirers confine themselves to a specific field of study or a particular
subject matter, while philosophers want to understand the whole. Sellars thinks that this philosophical skill is
most clearly demonstrated when we try to understand the connection between the natural world as we
experience it directly (the “manifest image”) and the natural world as science explains it (the “scientific
image”). He suggests that we gain an understanding of the nature of philosophy by trying to reconcile these two
pictures of the world that most people understand independently.
