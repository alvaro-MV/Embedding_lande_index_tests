Human 1: Hi!

Human 2: How's it going?

Human 1: I'm so sleepy today!

Human 2: Not enough sleep last night?

Human 1: yeah was working all night on a homework

Human 2: Oh really? What class?

Human 1: Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha


Human 2: Haha, are you in med school? Or are you pre-med?

Human 1: no high school actually haha

Human 2: haha, very ambitious for a high schooler! Do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice?

Human 1: I wanna be a brain surgeon!!

Human 2: Ooof! VERY ambitious. Do you have steady hands?

Human 1: Kind of I think

Human 2: I guess I can practice?

Human 1: Is that something you can practice?

Human 2: I don't know tbh

Human 1: I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!

Human 2: good point. I should ask my teacher if I have to be born with that

Human 1: Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!

Human 2: yeah

Human 1: What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
